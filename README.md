The following scripts generate the data and results of the paper:

*make_term_frequencies.py*

This script reads in the corpus of congressional speeches and generates speech-level term frequencies (counts of bigrams), god dummies (whether the word "god" is in the speech) and metadata (including speaker characteristics, e.g. political party). As mentioned in Section 3.2 of the paper, we align our pre-processing steps with Gentzkow et al. (2019) as our measure of speech partisanship makes use of partisanship scores of bigrams generated by the authors of that paper.
